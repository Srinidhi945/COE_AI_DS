## 🎯 About The Project

This project is a personal log of my journey through AI & DS. The primary goal is to solidify my understanding by applying theoretical knowledge to practical, hands-on coding exercises. The notebooks are designed to be self-explanatory and serve as a useful reference for implementing various models and techniques.

## ✨ Topics & Concepts Covered

This collection spans the entire data science pipeline, from data wrangling to model deployment.

* **Data Science Fundamentals**: `pandas`, `numpy`, EDA, Visualization (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
* **Machine Learning ($\text{Scikit-learn}$)**: Regression, Classification, Clustering, PCA.
* **Deep Learning ($\text{TensorFlow / PyTorch}$)**: ANNs, CNNs for Computer Vision, RNNs for sequence data.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Text Preprocessing, `TF-IDF`, `Word2Vec`, Sentiment Analysis.
* **Generative AI & LLMs**: Building Chatbots using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with `LangChain`.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to prepare the environment for this project.

### 1. Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* `git` (for cloning)

### 2. Get the Project Files
You have two options to get the files:

* **Option A: Git Clone (Recommended)**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Srinidhi945/COE_AI_DS.git
    cd COE_AI_DS
    ```
* **Option B: Download Manually**
    You can download the entire repository as a ZIP file from the main page (`Code` > `Download ZIP`) or download individual `.ipynb` files as needed.

### 3. Install Dependencies
For local development, it's best to use a virtual environment. Each notebook lists its required packages at the top. Install them using `pip` as needed.

### 4. Add API Keys (For RAG/LangChain Notebooks)
The chatbot notebooks require API keys (e.g., from OpenAI) to function.
1.  Create a file named `.env` in the main project folder.
2.  Add your keys to this file, for example: `OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."`
3.  **Important:** Add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` to keep your keys private.

## 🚀 Next Steps

I plan to continue expanding this portfolio with more advanced projects. Future additions may include:

* **Model Deployment**: Deploying a machine learning model as a REST API using Flask or FastAPI.
* **Advanced Computer Vision**: Projects on Object Detection (like YOLO) or Image Segmentation.
* **Advanced NLP**: Fine-tuning modern Transformer models from Hugging Face for specific tasks.
* **MLOps Practices**: Integrating tools like MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning.
