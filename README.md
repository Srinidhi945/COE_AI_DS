## üéØ About The Project

This project is a personal log of my journey through AI & DS. The primary goal is to solidify my understanding by applying theoretical knowledge to practical, hands-on coding exercises. The notebooks are designed to be self-explanatory and serve as a useful reference for implementing various models and techniques.

## ‚ú® Topics & Concepts Covered

This collection spans the entire data science pipeline, from data wrangling to model deployment.

* **Data Science Fundamentals**: `pandas`, `numpy`, EDA, Visualization (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
* **Machine Learning ($\text{Scikit-learn}$)**: Regression, Classification, Clustering, PCA.
* **Deep Learning ($\text{TensorFlow / PyTorch}$)**: ANNs, CNNs for Computer Vision, RNNs for sequence data.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Text Preprocessing, `TF-IDF`, `Word2Vec`, Sentiment Analysis.
* **Generative AI & LLMs**: Building Chatbots using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with `LangChain`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to prepare the environment for this project.

### 1. Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* `git`

### 2. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone [https://github.com/Srinidhi945/COE_AI_DS.git](https://github.com/Srinidhi945/COE_AI_DS.git)
cd COE_AI_DS

Of course. I've updated the README to include a "Next Steps" section and revised the dependency installation instructions to be more general, as you requested.

Here is the complete, updated README.md in a single block for you.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to prepare the environment for this project.

### 1. Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* `git`

### 2. Clone the Repository or download required .ipynb files 
```sh
git clone [https://github.com/Srinidhi945/COE_AI_DS.git](https://github.com/Srinidhi945/COE_AI_DS.git)
cd COE_AI_DS

3. Install Dependencies
For local development, it's best to use a virtual environment. Each notebook lists its required packages at the top. Install them using pip as needed.

4. Add API Keys (For RAG/LangChain Notebooks)
The chatbot notebooks require API keys (e.g., from OpenAI) to function.
Create a file named .env in the main project folder.
Add your keys to this file, for example: OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
Important: Add the .env file to your .gitignore to keep your keys private.

Next Steps
I plan to continue expanding this portfolio with more advanced projects. Future additions may include:
Model Deployment: Deploying a machine learning model as a REST API using Flask or FastAPI.
Advanced Computer Vision: Projects on Object Detection (like YOLO) or Image Segmentation.
Advanced NLP: Fine-tuning modern Transformer models from Hugging Face for specific tasks.
MLOps Practices: Integrating tools like MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning.
